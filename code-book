About R script
File with R code "run_analysis.R" perform 5 following steps (in accordance assigned task of course work)

About variables:
1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

1) 

a. Read and check data structure for all files:  
test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns

b. Read and Assign each data to variables
C.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
    X (10299 rows, 561 columns) 
    Y (10299 rows, 1 column) 
    Subject (10299 rows, 1 column) 
    Merged_Data (10299 rows, 563 column)

2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each variable.

3 & 4). Code column in TidyData renamed into activities
All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

5) MyData (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting All_Data, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Entire numbers in code column of the MyData replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable
